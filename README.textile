h2. SwOOp

Simple Web OOp!

SwOOp is originally a fork from "Spark":https://github.com/perwendel/spark whose goal was to replace JEE Servlet dependency (originally from Jetty) by a non-blocking and event based HTTP server. After some initial refactorings, this project has emerged as a complete rewriting in order to have a more flexible and easier to test basis. After investigation, the underlying HTTP server used will be "Webbit":https://github.com/webbit/webbit which is based on "Netty":http://www.jboss.org/netty
